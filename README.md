# Estimation-Theory-new-assignment-wiener-filter
In this assignment we are going to solve two wiener filter problems

Hi

This is an estimation theory assignment from KN Toosi university of Technology, Iran, Tehran. Prof. Saeed Khankalantari. Teaching Assistant Mohamad Ghashangzadeh.

This assignment requires a basic knowledge of Estimation Theory, and Matlab programming Language.

Problem 1 is exactly from the book Introduction to Optimal Estimation-Springer-Verlag London (1999) in this problem we just did the matlab coding and we dropped the paper-and-pencil part!

Problem 2 is just a simple proof we are going to prove!
